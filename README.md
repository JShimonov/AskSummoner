# AskSummoner

Thought that it would be fun to experiment with the API from the company that allows me to play a great game on my free time
(AKA League of Legends). In exploring this API, I found that there are so many cool and interesting things that I can make out
of it. This project is meant to explore the other summoners (or players) in your game. The end goal of this project is to incorporate all the possible API methods to eventually create a Discord bot that allows players to ask about the players that they are up against - hence the name AskSummoner

Also learning Python in the process, which is another plus.

- [x] Allowed to search summoners
- [x] Find all their ranks in solo/duo queue and flex queue

- [x] Display most recent match history
- [x] Implement as Discord bot

## Things to add in the future
