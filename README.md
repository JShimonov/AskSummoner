# AskSummoner

Thought that it would be fun to experiment with the API from the company that allows me to play a great game on my free time
(AKA League of Legends). In exploring this API, I found that there are so many cool and interesting things that I can make out
of it. This project is meant to explore the other summoners (or players) in your game. The end goal of is to see whether the player
is actually good at their champion (or character) or if they are smurfing (never played the character before, but somehow really good).

Also learning Python in the process, which is another plus.
